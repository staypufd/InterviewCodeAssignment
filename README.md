A small sample of a very minimal MVVM SwiftUI app

v0.1 - Minimal MVVM model.  The detail view was passed its account object and didn't use a view model, as it was read-only.
v0.2 - Extended MVVM model. The request was made to show more ViewModel; thus, this version uses a view model for the detail view.
